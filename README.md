Airbnb Dataset Exploration and Machine Learning

**Project Summary:**


As a team, we assigned with locating a dataset of our choosing, performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, and finally building machine learning models. We chose an Airbnb dataset because of the varied and interesting features and the relevance of the subject matter. Each row of the "Listings" dataframe represents a listing on Airbnb, containing information about the property itself and the host.

**Data Source:**

Our datasets were taken from Kaggle.
